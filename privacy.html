            <h2>Chrome Web Store Privacy Practices</h2>
            
            <h3>Single Purpose Description</h3>
            <p>This extension's single purpose is to monitor specified subreddits for new posts and send notifications to Discord channels via webhooks, helping users stay updated on their favorite subreddit activities without manual checking.</p>

            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <p>Reddit Notifier for Discord is a powerful Chrome extension that automatically monitors your chosen subreddits for new posts and sends instant notifications to your Discord channels through webhooks. With customizable refresh intervals, support for multiple subreddits (premium), and a user-friendly interface, it helps you stay connected to your favorite Reddit communities without constant manual checking. The extension features both free and premium tiers, with advanced features like faster refresh rates and multiple subreddit monitoring available in the premium version.</p>

            <h3>Permissions Justification</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alarms:</strong> Required to schedule periodic checks for new Reddit posts at user-specified intervals. This ensures reliable background monitoring without excessive resource usage.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> Needed to access Reddit.com for monitoring subreddits and Discord.com for sending webhook notifications. These permissions are essential for the core functionality of checking posts and sending notifications.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Remote Code:</strong> Used solely for interacting with Reddit's API and Discord's webhook system. No arbitrary remote code execution is performed; all operations are limited to API interactions for post monitoring and notification delivery.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Required to save user preferences, webhook URLs, monitored subreddit lists, and tracking previously seen posts to prevent duplicate notifications. All data is stored locally on the user's device.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Tabs:</strong> Needed to manage background tabs for Reddit monitoring and refresh existing Reddit tabs when checking for new posts. This permission optimizes the monitoring process and prevents opening duplicate tabs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Usage Compliance</h3>
            <p>We certify that our extension's data collection and usage comply with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies.
